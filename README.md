# China Tea Company


Project One: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

My idea here was to create a website where people who were interested in Chinese tea could be easily informed about the availability of both teas as well as tea-ware. I wanted it to be a simple "shop front" with clear concise information with an easy way to progress to a purchase  
## UX



### What is this website for?

It is a place to order Chinese tea and/or tea-ware online


### What does it do?

It provides a simple website where people who are interested in Chinese teas and tea-ware
can see what is available and buy from the online vendor. My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while maintaining a minimalist design.
I also wanted to keep the layout as traditional as possible so as to allow the user to feel at home while navigating the site. The mobile first approach will be used in order to focus on this experience first and for a faster loading times mobile devices. The design will be expanded from here to suite larger viewports.

### User Stories:

As a traditional tea drinker I want to be made aware of teas from an origin which is different from the one I usually source my tea/tea-ware from. I want to be made aware of what is available and be able to move to a purchase with one click
