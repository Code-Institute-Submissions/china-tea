# China Tea Company


Project One: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

My idea here was to create a website where people who were interested in Chinese tea could be easily informed about the availability of both teas as well as tea-ware. I wanted it to be a simple "shop front" with clear concise information with an easy way to progress to a purchase  
## UX



### What is this website for?

It is a place to order Chinese tea and/or tea-ware online


### What does it do?

It provides a simple website where people who are interested in Chinese teas and tea-ware
can see what is available and buy from the online vendor. My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while maintaining a minimalist desig
I also wanted to keep the layout as traditional as possible to as to allow the user to feel at easy while navigating the site. A mobile first approach has been used to allow for faster loading time on a mobile device as well as an expandable design.

### User Stories:

As a traditional tea drinker I want to be made aware of teas from an origin which is different from the one I usually source my tea/tea-ware from. I want to be made aware of what is available and be able to move to a purchase with one click

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)


### What are the features?


1. Drop down menu which allow the user to quickly see what options are available and to navigate to them
2. A main introductory landing page with navigation functions and basic company information. This is to inform the user of who we are and what can be expected from the website.
3. Images portraying the offerings of the company with a short description bolow of what they are. This is to allow the user an easy way to make a decision on where they would like to progress to.
4. Buttons for choosing each item. Easily make the choice to proceed to purchase.
5. A jumbotron signing up for a newsletter with an option that opens up a modal that allows the user to enter their details.
6. Instagram button with images from the instagram account of the company. The user is able to see samples of our Instagram account and make the choice to link directly to it.
7. The address for the company with a background image of the area. 
8. Facebook, youtube and twitter links in the footer. Direct links to social media accounts.

### Features left to implement:

In the future I would like to add a link from the address area to googlemaps.
