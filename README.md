# China Tea Company

My idea here was to create a website where people who were interested in Chinese tea could be easily informed about the availability of both teas as well as tea-ware. I wanted it to be a simple "shop front" with clear concise information with an easy way to progress to a purchase

## UX/UI

### What is this website for?

It is a place to order Chinese tea and/or tea-ware online


### What does it do?

It provides a simple website where people who are interested in Chinese teas and tea-ware
can see what is available and buy from the online vendor. My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site while maintaining a minimalist design.
I also wanted to keep the layout as traditional as possible so as to allow the user to feel at home while navigating the site. The mobile first approach will be used in order to focus on this experience first and for a faster loading times mobile devices. The design will be expanded from here to suite larger viewports.


### User Stories:

* As a traditional tea drinker I want to be made aware of teas from an origin which is different from the one I usually source my tea/tea-ware from. I want to be made aware of what is available and be able to move to a purchase with one click
* As a tea drinker with an ecletic taste I was a website the looks and feel niche where I can be informed of new options so that I can add new variety to my collection.
* As a customer I was to buy tea from a vendor that is different from the standard commercial outlets where I can created an account and create an online relationship with a small specialised vendor.

### Ideal Customer:

* Aged thiry and above with a high level of disposable income and a willingness to spend on luxury items
* A long standing history of tea drinking.
* Active in reviewing products and services online.
* Socialises in similar groups.

#### Manual (logical) testing of website:


Images of products tested as not working in the format of the original framework. Images of products put in ascending order with deep red border and black shadow for improved definition and appearence.
The images files were also too large and it was affecting loading time on all formats. The largest files were re-sourced from Pixabay.com in a lower resolution. All imgages were then processed using TinyPNG to create smaller files. Loading time was tested and signigicantly improved.
Image of free sample and text moved into jumbotron for improved design
The Navbar was tested as looking to complicated and imposing and was simplified and made transparent. All products placed in a dropdown link.
The wireframes mockup pdf file was not loading so I deleted it and then uploaded again. Now works.


After feedback from users the following things were changed:
Hero image was tested as too dark and a lighter image was chose. This was to make the appearence lighter and the fonts more readable.
All links in the navbar,call to action buttons and social media links tested as active
The image used as a footer looked unnecesarry and a much simpler footer was put in it's place. Facebook, twitter and youtube links moved up and into the Instagram container for a simplified more accessable layout.


All deployments were tested on the folowing:

Hardware:
* Desktop PC
* Macbook Air
* Iphone 10S
* Samsung S10
* Huawei tablet

Software:
